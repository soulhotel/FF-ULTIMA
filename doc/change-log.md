### Change Log:
- `new` Alternate color scheme: See the [Catppuccin Edition](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/tree/main/theme/color-schemes/catppuccin) to learn more.
- `new` Color schemes are even easier to create: Learn how on the [New Color Scheme](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/blob/main/doc/New-Color-scheme.md) page.
- `new` Setting `ultima.sidebery.autohide` autohide's Sidebery **only**, while other Sidebar Tabs remain static, by @frandmb [#88](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/pull/88).
- `new` Setting `ultima.OS.mac` can now be used for any OS, to simulate left side title bar buttons.
- `fix` Close button for tabs not visible when in Fullscreen Mode, [#30](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/issues/30).
- `qol` Styling for pinned tabs vs selected tabs have been adjusted and simplified.
- `qol` About:config warning-dialog automatically set to false through user.js.
- `qol` Code miniaturization.
- `qol` Setting `ultima.OS.kdedecoration` for KDE Users who may have themed window decoration applied to firefox.
- `qol` Color Variables have been adjusted; excess removed, readability improved (hopefully). Some changes include but are not limited to:
  - Name shortening from `uc-ultima-etc` to `uc-etc`
  - `uc-light-dark` and `uc-dark-light` removed/merged into `uc-text`. Functionality has not changed.
  - `uc-panel-border` is utilized more often, specifically for every element that has a modified border.
  - `uc-background-etc` - background variables are a bit more specific, for tabs, panels, etc.
  - Many nested elements (with altered backgrounds) now adopt their parents related background variable.
  - The application of variables can sometimes rely on user preference.. so feedback is appreciated for these and future changes.
