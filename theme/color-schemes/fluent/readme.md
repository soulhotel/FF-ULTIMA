FF ULTIMA
Fluent Edition
By @dreadbalaur
```
Designed based Microsoft's Fluent colours, with the aim of matching niivu's Fluent theme for Windows 10.

*"I'm a Thinkpad user, so the alternative Thinkpad version just replaces all accent colours with reds. 
Rename 'ffu-colorscheme.thinkpad.css' to 'ffu-colorscheme.css' to use that version.*

*There is no set wallpapers yet, since my homepage/new tab is managed by HexagonTabs. The wallpapers in the previews are just photos I took.*"

To use this color scheme:
- Navigate to `about:config` page.
- Search for `user.theme`.
- Turn on `user.theme.fluent`
- Or `user.theme.fluent.thinkpad` ðŸ«¡
