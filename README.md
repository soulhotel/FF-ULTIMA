<details><summary>The Easy Way</summary>

###### 🛈 Autoconfig Users should download the Source instead of the release Zip 🛈

1. Download the latest version on the [release page](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/releases/latest).
2. Copy everything in the ffultima.zip into your `chrome` folder.

5. Restart Firefox.
6. <ins>**Wait** for Firefox to open</ins>, then delete the `user.js` file.

###### 🛈 For this method, all you need is Git and a Terminal. It's harder for the less technical people 🛈

- This automated tool requires no download. It runs by fetching [gituserChrome](https://github.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome)
- Locates all profile folders and allows you to specify which one to install FF Ultima to
- It renames any present chrome/ folder to chrome.old/, then uses git to install the theme to a new chrome/ folder
- It also handles moving the user.js, restarting specific firefoxs, and user.js removal
- To Install FF Ultima - copy/paste the command for your operating system

###### LINUX ([BASH SCRIPT](https://github.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome)):
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome/main/scripts/gituserChrome.sh)
```

###### WINDOWS ([POWERSHELL SCRIPT](https://github.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome)):
```
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex (irm 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulhotel/git-userChrome/main/scripts/gituserChrome.ps1')"
